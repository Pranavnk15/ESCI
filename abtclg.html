        <h3>About NMVPM</h3>

        <p>
            Nutan Maharashtra Vidya Prasarak Mandal is a highly respected education society in Maharashtra and is credited with starting national education schools in the Maval Region of Pune district over 100 years ago. The great freedom fighter Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak was the founder member of the Mandal and was the Chairman of its Governing Body for almost 12 years. The late Hon. Vishnu G. Vijapurkar was the first Secretary of “Samarth Vidyalaya” – the first national school started by the Mandal. He was imprisoned by the British authorities for his so called anti British activities. Vishnu Ganesh Pingle was a Vibrant Student of Samarth Vidyalaya. He became a leader of the Gaddar Party of Lala Hardayal and was hanged by the British for his revolutionary activates when he was barely 26. The Mandal and its schools has such rich heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the first 80 years, the Mandal established good Primary and Secondary Schools in the Maval region with the sole intention of providing education to the youth of relatively backward area of the Pune District. In 1998, it established a Polytechnic College and during the last decade, over 1000 students received quality technical education in the Maval region. The Society (Mandal) has thus helped the nearby community in raising its economic and education standard. The progressive, dynamic and dedicated management of the Nutan Maharashtra Vidya Prasarak Mandal has decided to start a four year degree engineering college from academic year 2008-2009. The new institute is named “Nutan Maharashtra Institute of Engineering & Technology (NMIET). NMIET stands committed to provide quality technical education to its students.”Nutan Maharashtra Institute of Engineering & Technology (NMIET)” is approved by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi and Director of Technical Education (DTE), Government of Maharashtra. It is affiliated to Pune University.
